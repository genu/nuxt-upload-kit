## Quick Setup

## TypeScript

Nuxt Upload Kit is written in TypeScript and ships with full type definitions. Types are automatically available when you use the module.

You can also import types directly if needed:

```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

1. **Use a NodeJS LTS version** - We recommend Node.js 18.x or 20.x
2. **Clear your package manager cache** and reinstall:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
   pnpm install
   ```
3. **Ensure Nuxt is up to date** - The module requires Nuxt 3.x or later
