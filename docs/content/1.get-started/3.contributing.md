# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nuxt Upload Kit! This guide will help you get started with development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18.x or 20.x (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10.x or later

## Development Setup

::steps

### Fork and Clone

Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:

```bash [Terminal]
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nuxt-upload-kit.git
cd nuxt-upload-kit
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm install
```

### Prepare Environment

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev:prepare
```

### Start Development Server

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev
```

This starts a playground application where you can test your changes in real-time.

## Making Changes

### Create a Branch

Create a descriptive branch for your changes:

```bash [Terminal]
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### Writing Tests

Tests are located in the `test/` directory and use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Please include tests for any new features or bug fixes.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm test        # Run once
pnpm test:watch  # Watch mode
```

### Type Checking

Ensure your changes pass type checking:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm test:types
```

## Creating Plugins

One of the best ways to contribute is by creating new plugins. See the [Custom Plugins](/advanced/custom-plugins) and [Custom Storage Adapters](/advanced/custom-storage-adapters) guides for detailed instructions.

### Validator Plugin Example

```ts
export const ValidatorExample = defineProcessingPlugin<{ option: string }>((options) => ({
  id: "validator-example",
  hooks: {
    validate: async (file, context) => {
      // Return file to pass, throw to reject
      return file
    },
  },
}))
```

### Storage Plugin Example

```ts
export const PluginStorageExample = (options: Options): StoragePlugin => ({
  id: "storage-example",
  hooks: {
    upload: async (file, context) => {
      // Upload logic, call context.onProgress(0-100)
      return { url: "...", ...metadata }
    },
    getRemoteFile: async (fileId, context) => {
      return { size, mimeType, remoteUrl }
    },
    remove: async (file, context) => {
      // Delete from storage
    },
  },
})
```

## Documentation

Documentation lives in the `docs/` directory and uses [Docus](https://docus.dev/).

To run the documentation site locally:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm docs:dev
```

When adding new features, please update the relevant documentation.

## Submitting a Pull Request

::steps

Before submitting, ensure:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm test        # All tests pass
pnpm lint:fix    # No linting errors
pnpm format      # Code is formatted
pnpm test:types  # Types are correct
```

### Push and Create PR

Push your branch and create a pull request on GitHub:
